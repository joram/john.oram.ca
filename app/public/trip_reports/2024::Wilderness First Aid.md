## Scene Assessment
- is it safe?
  - fire, wire, gas, glass, bugs, drugs

- what happened?
  - mechanism of injury?
  - spinal injury?

## Primary Survey
- level of consciousness
  - alert
  - verbal
  - pain (pinch shoulder)
  - unresponsive
- ABCs
  - Airway (normal is 12-20 breaths per minute)
    - is it open?
    - is it clear?
  - Breathing
    - is it regular?
    - is it laboured?
  - Circulation
    - is there a pulse?
    - is there bleeding?
extremities cold, gray/pail, cold sweaty
  - Deadly Bleeding (check via rapid body survey)
    - Rapid Body Survey
      - pat head to toe (then arms)
      - check hands with each pats
      - look for life threatening injuries
      - look for medical alert tags
  - Spinal/Shock
    - low blood pressure
    - shunting (blood moves to essential organs)
    - pale, cool, clammy skin
    - rapid breathing
    - Treatment:
      - keep dry and warm (for wilderness, do this even with spinal injury)
      - calm and reassure
      - keep resting

## Choking
- if they can cough, let them cough (and encourage)
- if they can't cough:
  - ask if they are choking, and if they want help
  - Repeat while concious:
    - do 5 back blows
    - do 5 abdominal thrusts
    - do 5 chest thrusts

### Self Choking
- call 911, tap 3 times
- use gravity to help abdominal thrusts
- use a chair or table to help back blows


## CPR
- 30 compressions
- 2 breaths
- repeat until 30min (at this point assume dead)
- use an AED if available
