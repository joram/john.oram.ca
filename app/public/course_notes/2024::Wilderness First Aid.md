# Wilderness First Aid

## Types of Incidents
| Type     | Description                 | Examples                                                          |
|----------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Minor    | non-trip ending             | blisters, splinters, cuts                                         |
| Major    | trip ending, self evacuated | sprains, small arm fractures, reasonably minor burns              |
| Critical | trip ending, assisted evac  | major fractures, major burns, major lacerations, any spinal stuff |

## Scene Assessment
- is it safe?
  - fire, wire, gas, glass, bugs, drugs

- what happened?
  - mechanism of injury?
  - spinal injury?

## Primary Survey
### level of consciousness
  - alert
  - verbal
  - pain (pinch shoulder)
  - unresponsive 
### ABCs
  - Airway (normal is 12-20 breaths per minute)
    - is it open?
    - is it clear?
  - Breathing
    - is it regular?
    - is it laboured?
  - Circulation
    - is there a pulse?
    - is there bleeding?
extremities cold, gray/pail, cold sweaty
  - Deadly Bleeding (check via rapid body survey)
    - Rapid Body Survey
      - pat head to toe (then arms)
      - check hands with each pats
      - look for life threatening injuries
      - look for medical alert tags
  - Spinal/Shock
    - low blood pressure
    - shunting (blood moves to essential organs)
    - pale, cool, clammy skin
    - rapid breathing
    - Treatment:
      - keep dry and warm (for wilderness, do this even with spinal injury)
      - calm and reassure
      - keep resting

## Secondary Survey
- *trick:* to check breathing, pretend to check pulse
- *capillary refill:* press on nail, should return to normal in 2 seconds
- *pupils:* should be equal and reactive (cover one eye, then the other)
- check pulse/breathing for 15s, then multiply by 4
- for irregular heart rate check for 30s and multiply by 2

- *SAMPLE* history
  - Signs and Symptoms
  - Allergies
  - Medications
  - Past Medical History
  - Last Oral Intake
  - Events Leading Up To Incident
- *OPQRST* history
  - Onset
  - Provocation
  - Quality
  - Region
  - Severity
  - Time
- *SOAP* notes
  - Subjective
  - Objective
  - Assessment
  - Plan

## Choking
- if they can cough, let them cough (and encourage)
- if they can't cough:
  - ask if they are choking, and if they want help
  - Repeat while concious:
    - do 5 back blows
    - do 5 abdominal thrusts
    - do 5 chest thrusts

### Self Choking
- call 911, tap 3 times
- use gravity to help abdominal thrusts
- use a chair or table to help back blows

## CPR
- 30 compressions
- 2 breaths
- repeat until 30min (at this point assume dead)
- use an AED if available

### burrito wrap
  - zig zag a rope the length of the patient
  - lay a tarp down
  - lay a sleeping pad down
  - lay a sleeping bag down
  - lay the patient down
  - pad the patient with extra clothing
  - wrap the patient in a mylar blanket
  - wrap the patient in the sleeping bag
  - wrap the tar around the sleeping bag/patient
  - tie the rope around the patient
    - starting at the feet
    - new through the old loop back and forth
    - tie a not at the head

    
## Spinal Injury
### To hand off:
  - elbow on chest, hold cheeks
  - wait for another person to grab the head
  - remove the temporary support
### Different ways of stabilizing head
  - hold traps, and elbows hold head
  - long+short
### Different ways to move (last resort)
  - elbow up, slide arm through
  - cross leg 
  - roll onto side (difficult)
  - cradle head and finish the roll


## Major Deadly Bleed
- REDDT (todo: flesh out)
  - Rest
  - Elevate
  - Direct Pressure
  - Direct Pressure
  - Tourniquet
### Tourniquet
- 2-3 inches above the wound
- 2-3 inches below the joint
- tighten until bleeding stops
- write the time on the forehead
- don't remove it (sepsis risk)
- don't cover it

## Sucking Chest Wound
- we don't stack gause, we replace so the saturated gause does not prevent air leaving the chest cavity.

## Impailments
- don't remove the object (unless...):
  - it prevents us from handling something more critical/life threatening
- leave the object in place
- stabilize the object
-
