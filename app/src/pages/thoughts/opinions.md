## different ways of doing things:
- as someone with opinions coming into a new work environment and tech stack, I want to bring up the deltas and other ways I've seen things done that worked well for those contexts.
- Any choice comes with pros and cons, most of them are two way doors, staying flexible and deferring choices that don't need to be made now is usually the right call, doing things the same way as others on your team is better than doing something differently because "my ways better".
- I would prefer to have a discussion, end with different views, and just default to Mike's opinion (or however we choose the default) over getting egos attached to any particular decision.

## Two way doors vs one way doors:
- Most decisions are easy to undo (walk back through the door). Those decisions can be quickly assessed, settled on, and then a choice is made.
- Few decisions are difficult to undo in tech (it's a gray zone of annoyance and difficulty), but at a certain point they should be considered "one way doors". Those decisions should be considered carefully and usually deferred as long as possible.

## Pit of success:
- Most ways of doing things should be designed so the easiest way is the right way. We should design the way we do things so the product we build is easy to iterate on and maintain.
- Breaking away from our standard way of doing things should only be done with good reason.

## TLDR:
- Make choices in processes/tools to make things built right, most of the time
- Disagree and commit for two way doors
- If you are deferring from the norm too often
- Defer and be cautious with one way doors
- Take everything I say with a grain of salt, there's always nuances, more context and improvements to evaluate
